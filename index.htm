<p>As you can see from the picture above, <b>Lake Tahoe</b> is a wonderful destination for a vacation! There are scenic trails, beaches, and hikes to go on while visiting. The Rubicon Trail is regarded as one of the best trails to go on due to its amazing views of the lake, distant mountains, and the shallow bays. The 1 most recommended beach site at Lake Tahoe, is the Sand Harbor Beach. The area includes a vistior center, picnic tables, trees, and a wide stratch of sunny sand. There is even a beach and cove specifically set up for SCUBA Divers! </p>

<p2>What is very nice about Lake Tahoe is how <b>clear</b> the water is. So while you are out in the water or on a boat you are able to see the bottom of the lake just by looking! Although the depth may seem shallow but is actually very deep. The maximum depth at this lake is <b>1,645 ft.</b> </p2>
